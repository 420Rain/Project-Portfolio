## About Me

Hi! I am Rainier Dulatre, a student at De La Salle University Manila. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a Major in Software Technology. One of my interests is programming, as I find satisfaction and thrill in thinking and implementing functioning programs. I have experience coding in C, Java, and a little bit of Python, HTML, and CSS. I may not have experience or proficiency in most languages but I have the eagerness to learn and apply new concepts and programming languages to broaden my knowledge and enhance my skills. I also look forward to growing by working with like-minded individuals and expanding my connections.

## About this Portfolio

The projects in this portfolio are mainly from **individual coursework** but are nonetheless applications of what I have learned in my programming journey so far. However, I look to expand this portfolio by also working on personal projects.
