Hi! I am Rainier Dulatre, a student at De La Salle University Manila. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a Major in Software Technology. One of my interests is programming, as I find satisfaction and thrill in thinking and implementing functioning programs. I may not have experience or proficiency in most languages but I have the eagerness to learn and apply new concepts and programming languages to broaden my knowledge and enhance my skills. I also look forward to growing by working with like-minded individuals and expanding my connections.

Tech Stack: C, Java, Javascript, Python

## About this Portfolio

The projects in this portfolio are mainly from individual and group projects related to academic courses. Nonetheless, these are applications of what I have learned in my programming journey so far. However, I look to expand this portfolio by also working on more projects in the future.
